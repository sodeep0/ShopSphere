# E-Commerce Features for "Krisha Krafts" Handicraft Store (Nepal, COD-Only, Free & Simple)

## Core Features (MVP - Essential for Handicraft Retail, Solo Dev)
1. **User Authentication & Profiles**
   - Basic sign-up/login (email/password for customers in Nepal).
   - Profile: Save delivery address for COD (e.g., Kathmandu or local areas).
   - One Admin Account: Pre-configured (e.g., email: admin@krishakrafts.com, role: 'admin') for store management; customers get 'customer' role.

2. **Product Catalog (Handicraft Inventory)**
   - List products (e.g., felt dryer balls, Tibetan statues, prayer wheels) from DB: Name, description, price (in NPR), image, stock quantity, category (e.g., "Felt Crafts", "Buddhist Statues", "Handlooms").
   - Simple search (by name/category) and filter (by stock/price; inspired by [feltkraft.com](https://feltkraft.com/) product grids).
   - Product page: Show stock level; prevent add-to-cart if out-of-stock; highlight Nepali artisan details.
   - Admin: CRUD for products (simple form); **CSV Import**: Upload CSV file to bulk-add/update products (columns: name, description, price, stock, category, image_url). Use free `csv-parser` library.

3. **Shopping Cart & Checkout (COD for Nepal Delivery)**
   - Add items (check stock), update quantity, remove.
   - Cart persists in localStorage.
   - Checkout: Enter address (with Nepal-specific fields like district), confirm COD (only option), place order.
   - On submit: Save to DB, decrement stock, email confirmation to customer/business (e.g., "Pay on delivery at [address]; contact for pickup in Nepal").

4. **Order Management**
   - Customer: View past orders with status.
   - Admin: View all orders, update status (e.g., to "Delivered" after COD collection), see total pending (one admin only).

5. **Basic Notifications**
   - Free email for order confirmations (includes order details for manual Nepal handling, e.g., via local courier).

## Optional Features (Post-MVP, If Time)
1. **Stock Alerts**
   - Admin email if stock low (e.g., for popular items like prayer wheels from [khusiinc.com](https://khusiinc.com/)).

## Non-Functional Features
- Mobile-responsive for Nepali users.
- Fast loads; SEO with meta tags (e.g., "Nepali Handicrafts").
- Data: Initial CSV import for handicraft stock (e.g., from artisan lists).

Implementation Notes:
- APIs: Handle NPR currency; image URLs from free hosts like Imgur.
- Handicraft Tip: Categories inspired by [nepalcraftshop.com](https://www.nepalcraftshop.com/) (e.g., jackets, statues).
- No advanced: No reviews/promotionsâ€”keep it like a basic online artisan shop.
