# System Architecture for "Krisha Krafts" Handicraft Store (MERN Stack, Nepal COD-Only)

## Overview
Simple MERN architecture for a Nepal-based handicraft store, emphasizing artisan inventory and COD. Modular for solo maintenance; free deployment. Supports CSV import for bulk product addition. Inspired by interoperable schemas for crafts [feltkraft.com](https://feltkraft.com/), with boundaries for API/DB like [warehouse.pypa.io](https://warehouse.pypa.io/architecture.html) but simplified.

Client-server: Frontend static, backend serverless.

## Components
1. **Frontend (React)**
   - UI for handicraft browsing/cart; Axios for APIs, including CSV upload form.

2. **Backend (Node.js/Express)**
   - APIs for products/orders; CSV parsing with `csv-parser`; one admin JWT.
   - Nodemailer for Nepal COD emails.

3. **Database (MongoDB)**
   - Schemas for handicrafts (e.g., categories like "Prayer Wheels"); Atlas free.

4. **External (Free)**
   - Gmail SMTP; Vercel.

## Data Flow
1. Admin CSV import: POST file → Parse → Bulk insert to DB.
2. Browse: GET products → Filter by "Handlooms" etc. (from [nepalcraftshop.com](https://www.nepalcraftshop.com/)).
3. Order: POST with address → Update stock, email.

## Non-Functional
- Scalability: For small Nepal store (low traffic).
- Security: Role check for one admin; HTTPS.

Risks: CSV errors → Validation middleware.
