# Design Guidelines for "Krisha Krafts" Handicraft Store (Minimal, Free, Nepal-Focused)

## Overall Design Principles
- **Theme**: Warm, cultural for Nepali handicrafts (e.g., earthy tones, Himalayan motifs; use free Tailwind for quick styling). Highlight "Made in Nepal" badges.
- **User Experience**: Simple navigation (Home > Products > Cart > Checkout); clear COD messaging ("Pay cash on delivery in Nepal").
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first (Tailwind handles this) for local users on varying connections.
- **Branding**: "Krisha Krafts" logo (upload free); use Unsplash for placeholders like felt crafts or statues.

## Key Pages (Limited to 4-5 for Solo Handicraft Store)
1. **Homepage**
   - Hero with "Authentic Nepali Handicrafts" banner and featured products grid (e.g., prayer wheels, felt items from [feltkraft.com](https://feltkraft.com/)).
   - Search bar and categories dropdown.

2. **Products Page**
   - Grid of cards (image, name, price in NPR, stock, "Made in Nepal").
   - Basic filters (e.g., "Felt Crafts", "Statues" inspired by [axiakrafts.com](https://axiakrafts.com/)).

3. **Product Detail**
   - Details + stock indicator + "Add to Cart" (disabled if zero); artisan story section.

4. **Cart & Checkout**
   - Item list with totals (NPR).
   - Address form (Nepal fields: district, post code) + COD button.

5. **Admin Page** (One Admin Access)
   - Tables for products/orders; forms for CRUD; CSV upload button for import.

## Tech Stack for Design (Free & Light)
- **CSS**: Tailwind CSS (via CDN).
- **Components**: Plain React (e.g., grids for handicraft displays).
- **Images**: Free uploads to Vercel; optimize for artisan photos.
- **Wireframing**: Free Figma.

## Performance Considerations
- Small bundle: Lazy load images of handicrafts.
- Test with free PageSpeed Insights.

Design Process (Solo):
1. Quick sketches with Nepal elements.
2. Build in stages (e.g., products grid first).
3. Test on phone for local users.
